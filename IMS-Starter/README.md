Inventory Management System Starter Project - By Muhamed Jakupovic
This is an inventory management system which allows users to create a customer, put items into an order and place an order. 

Getting Started
Below I have listed the programs you will need to run this on your local device.

Prerequisites
Here is the list:

Java 1.8 or later (excluding Java 15). Java 1.8 was used for creation

SQL 5.7 or later. SQL 5.7 was used for creation

Eclipse was used for the back end programming

Tools Used
I also used draw.io to make the ERD diagram, I used microsoft excel to make the risk assessment.

Installing
To Install, clone the project fork and then clone the date to your local Desktop or PC and save in a Git/Github folder. Using an IDE open the File Column and select Open Project From File System and select the IMS-Starter file from whichever folder you have saved the project on.

Running the tests
To be able to test within the IMS-Starter file navigate to the control directory and run a mvn package on the file to push any tests through the command. To manually test within Eclispse, right click on the IMS-Starter project and select run Coverage As, as a JUnit Test.

Unit Tests
The unit tests that are within the file are essentially testing that every and all method/constructors within classes I have been able to pass the tests with at least 50% coverage.
